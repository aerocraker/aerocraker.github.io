<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="../images/vacay-home-page.png">

Our team used various technologies to change the Office of Election's volunteer registration system from an analog system to a digital system. The way we did this was by removing the need to have a phone call placed to register to volunteer on election day. The User is able to select what role they want to volunteer for.
