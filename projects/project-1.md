summary: My team and I created a visualization of Seattle's homeless population.
---

We created a visualization of Seattle's homeless population using R and plotly. The project is supposed to represent what resources Seattle has to offer to homeless people. We did this project because we wanted to see where the resources are being allocated around the city. What we learned from this is that a lot of the concentration of homeless people were around Seattle's downtown area but resources avaiable to them are outside of the downtown area.

The use of Google Maps API was to show how dense the homeless population around Seattle was. Additionally, we showed other metrics of resources vs homeless population on the site we created using ShinyApps.
