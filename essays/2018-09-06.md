## Smart question
[Smart Question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18498598/sorting-array-based-on-custom-priority-of-one-attribute?noredirect=1&lq=1)

The reason why this is a smart question is because the poster attempts to explain everything that they are trying to do. For instance, they provide the JSON that they are working on:

```
[
{
  "LAST":"Betsy",
  "FIRST":"Jackson",
  "DEPT":"Customer Service",
  "SUBDEPT":"Tech Support",
  "JOINED":"02/94",
  "TITLE":"Technical Customer Service Representative",
  "RESIDENCE":"Someplace",
  "HOBBIES":"Reading, Walking, Sleeping"
},
{
  "LAST":"Sally",
  "FIRST":"Smith",
  "DEPT":"Customer Service",
  "SUBDEPT":"Installation Customer Service Representative",
  "JOINED":"01/04",
  "TITLE":"Technical Customer Service Representative",
  "RESIDENCE":"Someplace",
  "HOBBIES":"Reading, Walking, Sleeping"
},
]
```

Along with the problem they are trying to solve by going into details. Where the problem is: 

"I'm trying to build an application where users can click on the name of an employee and see a refresh of results where every employee in that employee's department is shown, organized by the sub-departments, and scrolled-down to the given employee"

```
$.each(data, function(i, employee) { 
    if (employee.DEPT == dept) {
    var employeetext = '<span class="name">'
     + employee.FIRST+' '+ employee.LAST+'</span>',
     employee.JOINED, 
     employee.TITLE, 
     employee.RESIDENCE, 
     '...', 
     employee.HOBBIES;  

        $('#employees').append('<div class="employee_block"><img src="" width="85" height="113">' + employeetext + '.</div>');  

        results.push(employee); 
}
})
```
