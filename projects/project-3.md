LGBT Homelessness is an issue that conservative citiies face our project helps an individual out before they become homeless by giving them the resources needed to be self sufficient.

What we did was create a simple website that contains resources for LGBT youth who are homeless specifically because they have a specific need that isn't met at regular homeless shelters.
