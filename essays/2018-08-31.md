## Reflection on Javascript

I think that Javascript is much easier to program in compared to other programming languages that I've learned. For example, you don't need to define variable type by `int` or `float`. In regards to ES6, I learned about the two new variable type `let` and `const`. `let` comes in handy because it's a block scope variable and `const` is useful because you don't have to worry about changing the variable if you do end up writing a modification to that variable in your code. From a software engingeering perspective Javascript is a good programming language to learn because of its relative ease to learn, it's robust usage, and frameworks supporting the language allows Javascript to work in both front-end and back-end.

Athlectic software engineering is fun, but it isn't useful for learning because it puts stress on the student to complete the WOD for a grade when WODs should be there for the student to learn how to program better. A better style of learning would be to complete WODs without time limits and go over an efficient solution to the code that you worked on.
